## Disclaimer
If you have issues, don't hesitate to report them.

However, I mainly make these plugins strictly for personal use.

## Features
+ Ignore certain buftypes and/or filetypes
+ Close all of a particular buftype and/or filetype all at once (including floating windows)
+ Close anything and everything with just one keybind!
+ Nothing to close but one single buffer? Close Neovim!
+ Automatic bang insertion (will force close a buffer/window if it is unmodified)

## Installation
Minimal Lazy.nvim example (no keybinds, up to you to call the functions by hand)
```lua
{
    "radioactivepb/smartclose.nvim"
}
```
Lazy.nvim example with default opts (uses default keybinds, see [Options](#options) for details)
```lua
{
    "radioactivepb/smartclose.nvim",
    opts = {}
}
```
## Options
Many options are available for easy keybindings and close actions
```lua
{
    "radioactivepb/smartclose.nvim",
    -- All displayed options are the defaults
    -- Anything commented out is not default, rather an example
    opts = {
        -- By default, any keybinds you do not pass to opts.keybinds will be instantiated
        -- using their default keys (below) unless disable_default_keybinds is set to true
        disable_default_keybinds = false,
        -- All the keybinds displayed below are the default keybinds
        keybinds = {
            -- Smart close
            smartclose = "<leader>k",
            -- Smart close!
            smartclose_force = "<leader>K",
        },
        -- How should smart close work for you?
        actions = {
            -- Want smart close to close all of something, all at once? Put it here!
            -- 'Close all' will prioritize closing all of a given filetype/buftype at once
            close_all = {
                filetypes = {
                    -- List any and all filetypes here
                    -- "lua",
                    -- "markdown"
                },
                buftypes = {
                    -- List any and all buftypes here
                    -- "terminal"
                },
                -- Close all floating windows when smart closing?
                floating = true,
                -- Close all empty buffers when smart closing?
                empty = false,
            },
            -- Want smart close to ignore something? Put it here!
            -- 'Ignore all' will keep smart close from closing a given filetype/buftype
            ignore_all = {
                filetypes = {
                    -- List any and all filetypes here
                    -- "lua",
                    -- "markdown"
                },
                buftypes = {
                    -- List any and all buftypes here
                    -- "terminal"
                },
            },
        },
    }
}
```
